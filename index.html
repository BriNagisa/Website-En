                My name's Brianna Nagisa Rosemary, I've been with game controllers and keyboards in my hands since I was a child and I'm a new digital content artist. What does this include? Well, it includes anything a computer can do. 
                I'm looking forward to make drawings, 3D models and even program websites and videogames. Mi great plan is to become a proffesional. I'm studying coding by my own and I'm willing to improve to work doing that and make good quality content.
                I also write stories, which I hope may become in novels, sold to the public or scripts for my future projects. In the future I hope I can make videogames that people will like. I will show you what I'm capable of right now.

                    I'll start by showing my drawings, not only those made by computer but also those made by hand with a pencil too. It's true that it's not my strong point, but I work hard and keep trying, because there're so many ideas I wanna make happen. 
                    I've been drawing digitally for a long time, and it's a bit more complicated for me, but i know the results can be more satisfying. My own logo and avatar from my webpage are made digitally by me.

                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>
                    It was a foggy morning like many others. From the window of her studio, sit on a chair made of dark wood and black leather, detective Mary Anne Edevane looked at the buildings that she had in front of her. She could see the humidity condensate in the glass of the window, half lost in her thoughts.
                    She had a police report in her hands. It was a case that the London Police Force couldn't solve by itself, and like many others, it was entrusted to her because of her skills and her wit. Many others compared her with Sherlock Holmes and other fictional detectives, famous for being infallible. And she was infallible too. At least, until that moment.
                    That case was making her go nuts. She kept looking at the papers over and over again. She turned the pages, looked and annalized each word, each phrase, each parragraph, even small notes and improvised sketches from whoever wrote that. Even if everything was well detailed, there were things she couldn't get at all. There were missing data for her equation, the situation seemed impossible.
                    For the first time, Mary Anne couldn't get an answer. She kept stuck for two days in that situation and she was tired of reaching a dead end. The only thing that took her off from her loop of hyphotesis and doubts was a series of soft hits at the studio door, which was already open, but whoever called always had the preference to call first.

                    Something I can do better than 2D drawings is 3D modelling and designing. Currently I'm using the program Blender for creating and renderizing my projects. Even el background of this website is made my me in Blender.
                    Currently I have very few projects made with this programm because I have just started, but soon I'll make much more, including the future models I'll be using in my own videogames.

                I don't have many website projects at the moment, but I programmed this page myself. I'm still starting to learn several programming languages.

                    My plan is to learn and dominate all those languages so I can program websites, computer programs, videogames, apps and even train AIs.

        As I've already said, my intention is to work as a videogame developer. I'm currently learning the necessary programming languages for that, but I already own the Unity and Godot Engines, and ways to learn how to use them. You'll see soon projects made in these engines.
